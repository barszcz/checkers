Checkers
========

Hi! I made a checkers game in Ruby.

If you want to play, git clone and run game.rb in Ruby.

Moves are given in the form of the rank and file of the piece to move and that of the desired tile, separated by a space (e.g. "c4 d5"). Chained jumps work the same way (e.g. "c4 e6 f4").

There's no computer player, so you'll have to find a friend.
